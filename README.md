# Stock_Screener_Web_Scraping

In this project we web scraped a stock screener to get an excel file with potential stocks for investing. Since there are many stocks to invest it is important to focus in a small group of them with high potential. Stocks in the list have the following criteria:

-They belong to the technology industry.
-They have a P/E ratio between 5 to 25.
-Their market capitalization are between 50M to 1B.
-They are outperforming their 50 day moving average.

With our program we can get in seconds an excel file with pontential stocks, otherwise it would take more time to filter manually and create a list. The web scraping file can be found as "StockScreener.ipynb", the excel file is "stocks_database.xlsx" and the criteria used to filter stocks can be visualized in "Stock_Screener_Filters.png".
